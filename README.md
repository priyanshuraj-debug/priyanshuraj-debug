# Hi there, I'm Priyanshu Raj! 👋

## 🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer | Open Source Contributor | Tech Explorer

I'm a first-year Computer Science student who's diving deep into the world of tech — learning, building, and contributing every single day.  

Currently exploring the **foundations of programming with C** and just made my **first open source contribution** — and trust me, that moment was pure joy!

---

### 🔥 What I'm up to right now:
- Learning **C Programming** thoroughly — logic is my superpower!
- Just made my **first Pull Request** in open source (First Contributions repo)
- Exploring **Git & GitHub** hands-on — branches, commits, pull requests
- Preparing to dive into **Frontend Web Development** very soon
- Planning to master **C++ & DSA** right after

---

### 💡 Goals for 2025:
- Build real-world projects and host my own **portfolio website**
- Land internships and get ahead of the curve despite being in a tier-3 college
- Become skilled in **Web Development**, **Open Source**, and eventually **App Development (Flutter)**
